COURSEPLAY EDITOR
This was developed as a way to quickly make adjustments to recorded or saved courses.  All editing is done in-game and on-screen by using hotkeys and the mouse.  You can drag waypoints to new positions, insert and delete waypoints, change waypoint type and speed.

CAVEATS
1) This has not been tested on multiplayer.
2) This has not been tested with autodrive.
3) Backup your courses before trying this for the first time.
4) Works with courseplay .00344 and .00350 Dev (didn't try other versions)

DEV NOTES
This file is intended to be included with CoursePlay.  See the bottom of this file for instructions on what to modify in other files.  Most of this will be handled in a merge, but the instructions contain explanations on why we are making the changes.

A SUGGESTION ON LEARNING HOW TO USE THE EDITOR
Let's record a simple course and make a simple change, then drive it and save it.
1) Start a new game where you have some cash and buy a pickup.
2) In the pickup, record a simple course and save it.
3) Set the HUD mode to 'Transfer' and start driving the course from the first waypoint.  Observe.
4) Stop driving and stay in the vehicle.
5) Enable the editor (LEFT CTRL E by default)
6) Move the mouse to the base of one of the waypoint handles. A small sphere will appear at the top of the handle to let you know that you have 'selected' it.  You don't need to click on a waypoint to select it. Just hold your mouse over it instead.  
7) Click and hold the left mouse button while moving the mouse to drag the waypoint.  Release the mouse button to stop dragging the waypoint.
8) Let's test your edit by manually driving the pickup to point at the start of the course, and start driving again.  The truck will follow the edited course.
10) Save the course by using the HUD disk icon and give it a name (since this is the first time we are saving this course).
11) Clear the course ('x' button on the HUD)
12) Load the course again and you'll see the changes in the course.  Make some more changes, and use the save hotkey (LEFT CTRL F6, see F1 for commands) to save this course.  All course handle balls will appear while it is saving, then the editor will toggle off.
13) That's pretty well all there is to it.

USE CASES

1) You just recorded a course, but one or more waypoints are not exactly where you want them.  Solution: Open the editor and drag the waypoints to the desired position.
2) Your recorded course has areas where the speed is too high (or low).  This can happen when a heavily loaded vehicle can't stop in time to load/unload or make a corner.  Solution: Use the hotkeys to adjust the speed of individual waypoints.
3) You recorded a course and forgot to put in a wait/unload/turn/reverse/crossing waypoint.  Solution: Use the hotkeys to insert a waypoint and change its type.
4) Your course has a waypoint that you want to remove.  Solution: Use the hotkeys to delete those waypoints.
5) You like part of your generated course, but want to remove part of it and insert a recorded course.  This might happen in the center of an irregularly shaped field where the up/down paths might not be optimal and for that part of the field, you could do better by driving manually.  Solution: Use the hotkeys to do a 'delete to end' to remove the bad part of the course and then save.  Then record your own course for this strangely shaped area and save it under a different name.  Then clear the courses, load in the original with the deleted points and then append the recorded course and then drag the waypoints to make a nice transition to your recorded course.  Save the combined courses as one course under a new name.  Now you have a good course.  This is great for telling ex. your harvester to go and clean up all those little patches in the turns that it missed earlier.
6) You added a new building to your farm and now your old course is too close to the building, or your course now runs through the building and/or obscures some waypoints.  Solution: Drag the waypoints as needed.  If the building has covered up the waypoints, use the Delete Next Waypoint hotkey to get rid of the hidden waypoints and then build a new path around the building.  This is actually the use case that inspired me to create this editor - I added new buildings and all my carefully laid out courses were invalid.

NOTES
1) You can change the editor key hotkeys like you change the normal game hotkeys.  The courseplay editor hotkeys are at the bottom of the list.
2) You can bring up the in-game control help panel (defaults to F1) to see available editor commands.  These commands, in addition to left clicking the mouse, are the only commands used for the editor.
3) The editor can't create courses from scratch.  It can only edit existing recorded or saved courses.
4) You can undo drags, inserts and single waypoint deletes.  Changing waypoint speed or type, or deleting waypoints to the end or start cannot be undone.  Deleting waypoints to the end or start clears the previous undo history.
5) Dragging is done by selecting a waypoint and then left-clicking and hold while moving the mouse.  Release the mouse button to stop dragging.
6) 'selected' means that the mouse cursor is over an editing handle base (there's a sphere at the bottom of the handle).  Selected waypoints handles will brighten and a white sphere will appear at the top of the handle.  You don't need to click for it to be selected.  Just hovering over it is enough for it to be 'selected'.
7) You can only select one waypoint at a time. There is no multiselect.
8) You must edit while in a vehicle that has a loaded or recorded course.  The editor will be disabled while driving the course or recording.
9) You don't need to save the edited course before driving it.
10) There is a hotkey (LEFT CTRL F6 by default) for saving, which will overwrite the course file.  
11) When you leave a vehicle, or cycle to another vehicle, your unsaved editing changes will be lost.  You will not be prompted to save your changes.  So be sure to save your edits if needed before leaving the vehicle or changing to another vehicle.
12) Changing waypoint types will allow you to change it to inappropriate types, such as putting a TURNEND before a TURNSTART.  This may cause unpredicatable driving, so be sure to use those types properly.
13) IMPORTANT: You can also use the normal save function (disk icon on HUD) to save the edited course, but you'll have to provide a course name.  Think of it as a 'Save as...' button.
14) To understand the courseplay HUD recording 'Turn' button, think of it as a 'Travel' button instead where when you start the 'turn' it it stops working and moves at higher speed to the end, where it starts working again at its normal speed.  Instead of the vehicle following waypoints, courseplay will try to dynamically navigate from the turn start to the turn end position.
15) When you record a course, each waypoint is generated at the center of the vehicle and the speed of the vehicle is recorded.  When you drive the course, there is no guarantee that the center of your vehicle will pass over each waypoint at the recorded speed.  Rather, courseplay and the Giants engine will dynamically calculate the path taken, given vehicle weight, speed, traffic and available space to come up with the actual course travelled.  So this is why you may need to edit your course.
16) Generated courses automatically set the speed to zero, which means that it will determine it's own calculated speed.  If you use the editor to set one of those zero speeds to anything but zero, that speed will be used instead of a calculated speed.  Set it back to zero to use a calculated speed.
17) For a manual course, the speed is never calculated, so enter (or record) whatever speed you like.  The vehicle will try to attain that speed.
18) You can't change the waypoint lane in the editor.  If you insert a waypoint, it will duplicate the selected waypoint lane if it has one.
19) You can delete from the selected waypoint to the end of the course (see F1 for command), or delete from the selected waypoint to the beginning of the course (see F1 for command).
20) You can remove an inner section of the course (let's say the middle third of the course) by: first saving the whole course as A, then deleting the first third and save that as A1, then reload A and delete the last third and save that as A3.  Then load A1 and then load and append course A3.  Then save it as B.  Course B now has the middle third missing and you can edit that as desired.
21) Be sure to keep your course end away from your course beginning or else your vehicle may start to circle aimlessly.  Having the start and end too close together confuses courseplay, so keep it at least, say 5 pickup lengths away.  
22) The editing handle vertical lines can have different colors: orange for normal, wait or unload.  Pinkish for reverse.  Blue for crossing.  Green for turn start.  Red for turn end.
24) It is possible to have a waypoing at the exact same position as another waypoint, and this may happen while creating a crossing waypoint.

TEST SCRIPT
1) Record a course consisting of all waypoint types (wait, unload, crossing, turn start, turn end and reverse).
2) Drive the course (Use a pickup in transfer mode)
3) Enable the editor and drag one waypoint to a new position.
4) Drag another waypoint to a new position.
5) Delete a waypoint.
6) Insert a waypoint.
7) Delete a next waypoint.
8) Undo all changes.  It should return to as you left it in step 2.
9) Select a waypoint and increase the speed by 1.
10) Select a waypoint and decrease the speed by 1.
11) Try changing waypoint types.
12) Delete waypoints to the end.
13) Delete waypoints to the beginning.
14) Save as filename 'test'.
15) Drag another waypoint.
16) Save and overwrite (CTRL-F6)
17) Clear course.
18) Load course 'test'.
19) Course should be as you left it in step 15.
20) Drive the course.
21) Enable the editor and make sure the waypoint info panel is working.
22) Make sure the default hotkeys are shown in F1.
23) Try to change a hotkey mapping.
24) After editing course 'test' and saving it, save the game and then reload the game and see if the course still works.
25) Make sure editor handles are visible in daylight and darkness.
26) Load a large course and make sure framerate is ok.
27) Launch game with Autodrive. You should not be able to edit an autodrive course.
