### Important Update Information™
We've got an out of date website for Courseplay, certainly not containing all the glorious information you might ever need. If there is something you find missing, just holler, we are always looking for volunteers to update it.

Go check out the **[Courseplay Homepage][CP Website Link]**

### "Achtung", "Wichtig", "Neu" und Konsorten

## Developer version 

**[Download here](https://github.com/Courseplay/courseplay/releases/latest)**

Please be aware you're using a developer version, which may and will contain errors, bugs, mistakes and unfinished code. Chances are you computer will explode when using it. Twice. If you have no idea what "beta", "alpha", or "developer" means and entails, steer clear. The Courseplay team will not take any responsibility for crop destroyed, savegames deleted or baby pandas killed. 

You have been warned.

If you're still ok with this, please remember to post possible issues that you find in the developer version. That's the only way we can find sources of error and fix them. 
Be as specific as possible:

* tell us the version number
* only use the vehicles necessary, not 10 other ones at a time
* which vehicles are involved, what is the intended action?
* Post! The! Log! to [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) or [PasteBin](http://pastebin.com/)
* For more details on how to post a proper bug report, visit our [Wiki](https://github.com/Courseplay/courseplay/wiki)
