This file is used to customize Courseplay for specific vehicles and implements.

Typically you'd include a vehicle/implement here if it needs some special treatment
to work correctly with Courseplay. For instance, some implements are offset to the
left or right side (like bale loaders), so when doing fieldwork, you want do drive
on the left or right of the actual course so the bale loader's pickup is aligned
with the course.

This file is the global configuration coming with your copy of Courseplay. If you
want your own vehicle config, you can create a file called
courseplayVehicleConfigurations.xml in your save game folder. Settings defined in
that file will override the settings defined here.

Custom settings are listed per vehicle, the vehicle is identified by its XML file
name (you can find this in the game's folder under data/vehicles/<make>/<model>/

A vehicle may have multiple implements attached. If multiple implements have the
same attribute defined here, Courseplay just uses the first value it finds, which
can be any of the multiple values.

You can define the following custom settings:

- toolOffsetX: offset of the tool's centerline relative to the course, left +, right -.
               For example, if your tool is 2 meters right use "-2.0" here.
