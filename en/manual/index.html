		<h1>Manual <span id="manualVersion">valid for v6.03 - work in progress</span></h1>

		<hr />

		<article class="manualSection" id="intro">
			<p>This manual aims to describe the Courseplay hud, the changeable settings, and the different drive modes. Most likely, there will be one or the other thing missing.</p>
			<p>If you find a topic not dealt with in this manual, please let us know.</p>
		</article>

		<!-- #################### -->

		<article class="manualSection" id="controls">
			<h2>Controls</h2>
			<p>In general, controlling Courseplay works with the mouse, due to free keys in Farming Simulator being rather rare. By using the <kbd title="Delete">DELETE</kbd> the Courseplay hud, where you can configure and control the drivers, is activated. Normally, the hud will be opened with the <span class="emphasize1">right mouse button</span>. Due to some controls like wheel loader, this will collide with opening the hud. In this case, you can go into our advanced Settings Page and deactivate it either for your current vehicle (first page) or global (second page) if you don't like to use <span class="emphasize1">right mouse button</span> at all.
			<p>More functions can be assigned to any key or the mouse buttons in the game's options menu.</p>
		</article>

		<!-- #################### -->
		<!-- HUD -->
		<article class="manualSection" id="hud">
			<h2>HUD</h2>
			<p>When opening the hud, the mouse controls are activated automatically. Meaning, you can not use the mouse to look around anymore. In order to deactivate the mouse controls, you need to click the right mouse button again. Alternatively you can click on the <span class="icon-close inline" title="close button"></span> in the upper right corner of the hud. Doing so closes the hud and deactivates the mouse controls.</p>
			<p>The hud is divided into multiple pages. You can navigate through those by clicking on the respective page icon at the very top. The pages' titles are displayed as a tooltip. Keep in mind the certain pages are deactivated while you're in a certain mode or vehicle.</p>
			<p>In the center section on each page, a multitude of settings and options can be set and commands be given, simply by clicking on the chosen action or its corresponding buttons <span class="icon-plus inline" title="plus"></span>/<span class="icon-minus inline" title="minus"></span>/<span class="icon-arrowUp inline" title="arrow up"></span>/<span class="icon-arrowDown inline" title="arrow down"></span>/<span class="icon-arrowLeft inline" title="left arrow"></span>/<span class="icon-arrowRight inline" title="right arrow"></span> with the <span class="emphasize1">left mouse button</span>. Certain values and settings like scrolling through the course list, the settings of widths, speeds oder percentages etc. can be altered in bigger steps by pressing the <kbd title="Control">CTRL</kbd> key while clicking on the buttons. Some values and areas (like the course list) also accept the mouse wheel. This is indicated by a mouse wheel icon appearing next to the mouse cursor.</p>
			<p>In the bottom part of the hud you'll find information about the driver, the loaded course and the current status.</p>

					<li>
						<h4>Start recording</h4>
						<p>With this option, Courseplay's recording mode is activated. You can drive and record the course that the driver should use later. When recording is active, you can deactivate mouse controls by clicking the right mouse button, so you can look around while driving and recording.</p>
						<p>See: <span class="emphasize2">"Recording mode"</span></p>

						<h4>Copy course</h4>
						<p>Lets you copy the exact course and waypoints from another vehicle. Also works with combined, generated or unsaved courses.</p>
						<p>First choose the vehicle whose course you want to copy, then press the <span class="icon-copy inline" title="copy button"></span> button. The current course and waypoints will be overwritten completely.</p>

						<p class="info"><span class="icon-infoSign inline"></span>See also: <a href="#fieldScanner" class="internal">field scanner</a></p>
						<p>While standing on a field, the field's edge/border path can be scanned. It is then displayed as blue lines and yellow dots (can be toggled with <span class="icon-eye inline"></span>).</p>
						<p>If you want to save the edge path, choose a new field number for it with <span class="icon-arrowUp inline"></span>/<span class="icon-arrowDown inline"></span>. If a field edge path with that number already exists, you can overwrite it, otherwise your can add the path to the list.</p>
						<p>Each manually scanned field is saved in the <code>courseplayFields.xml</code> file and loaded with the savegame.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Course generation...</h4>
						<p>Opens the advanced course generator</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section class="manualSubSection">
				<h3>Recording mode</h3>
				<p>During the recording of a course, each newly recorded waypoint will be displayed with an orange pyramid dummy. Multiple buttons are displayed that let you influence the waypoints' settings. The buttons' functions are displayed as a tooltip when hovering over them.</p>
				<p>You should make sure to go more or less straight until reaching the third waypoint.</p>
				<p>The recorded course is only temporary: the next time you start the savegame, it will be gone, unless you save it first. (See: <a href="#hud_manageCourses" class="internal"><span class="icon-page2"></span> Manage courses</a>)</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h4><span class="icon-recordingStop"></span>Stop recording</h4>
						<p>When reaching the end point of your route, use "stop recording". It is advised to have the end point ca. 5 to 10 m before the start point, and for it to have about the same direction as the start point. Meaning: don't stop at a south direction while the course's start direction is north.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4><span class="icon-recordingPause"></span>Pause/continue recording</h4>
						<p>Pause the current recording. This option is only available after the third waypoint. A yellow arrow will be displayed, showing the direction to the last waypoint. Click the pause button again to continue. In addition, while paused you can delete the last waypoint (see <span class="emphasize2">"delete last waypoint"</span>).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4><span class="icon-recordingDeleteWaypoint"></span>Delete last waypoint</h4>
						<p>This option is only available when the recording is paused. The current last waypoint is deleted. You can repeat this until only three waypoints are left.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4><span class="icon-waitPointSign"></span>Set waiting point</h4>
						<p>While recording, you have the possibility to set waiting points on the course. At those points, the driver, while driving the course, will stop and wait until either you tell him to continue, or the configured waiting time has passed. When a driver reaches a waiting point, a message will be displayed (<code>XYZ has reached waiting point.</code>).</p>
						<p>In certain modes, waiting points have special meanings, other than waiting: in the <a href="#driveMode4" class="internal"><span class="icon-mode4single"></span> fertilizer/seeding</a> mode, the wait point defines a position where the worker stops and wait until he got his set min% value reached, this can be done by a player or by a courseplay driver. They also indicate the start and end of the work area, as well as the area where to check for an unload point for <a href="#driveMode9" class="internal"><span class="icon-mode9single"></span> shovel filling and unloading</a> mode and for <a href="#driveMode3" class="internal"><span class="icon-mode3single"></span> overloader</a> mode, to set the overloading position.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4><span class="icon-crossSign"></span>Set crossing point</h4>
						<p>Crossing points are "signal" or "combination points" where two separate courses can be combined (see <a href="#hud_manageCourses" class="internal"><span class="icon-page2"></span> Manage courses</a>). In both courses, two crossing points (one in each course) that are closer to each other than 50 metres are determined. The combined course will lead up until the first course's crossing point, and from there go the second course from its respective crossing point.</p>
						<figure>
							<img src="../../res/img/manual_mergeCourse_en.jpg" class="infoImg">
							<figcaption>Combination of two courses at their crossing points</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p><span class="emphasize1">Note:</span> A course's start and stop points are automatically set as crossing points. Hence, they don't have to be manually declared as those when recording.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4><span class="icon-recordingTurn"></span>Start/finish turn maneuver</h4>
						<p>While it is generally advised to have field courses generated, they can also be recorded manually. Setting the turn maneuver later tells the driver to do a turn maneuver on his own at this point - meaning lifting and/or turning off the tool. Clicking once activates the turn maneuver (the button turns green), clicking it again ends it.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4><span class="icon-recordingReverse"></span>Reverse driving</h4>
						<p>Courseplay supports reverse driving with trailers in many modes. Activating this option later tells the driver to drive this portion of the course in reverse. You should only activate and deactivate it once you're at a complete stop and not rolling anymore. When active during the recording, you must drive in reverse, otherwise there will be severe driving errors later. Clicking once activates the reverse mode (the button turns green), clicking it again ends it.</p>
						<p class="info"><span class="icon-infoSign inline"></span> See also: <a href="#reverseDriving" class="internal">Reverse driving</a></p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4><span class="icon-unloadhere"></span>Unload here</h4>
						<p>Unload here points are used to tell the driver to create a heap, like a beet rental. They are also used in unloading chaff into a bunker when fill them up in reverse, as well as unloading bales.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section class="manualSubSection">
				<h3>Course loaded, not driving</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h4>Drive course</h4>
						<p>When you have recorded or loaded a course, you can "hire" a driver to have him drive the course. From this moment on, you won't have any manual control over the tractor until you stop the driver.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Start course at&hellip;</h4>
						<p>Some courses have relatively many waypoints in a small area, especially at the starting point (e.g. generated courses with headland). Here you can choose if the driver starts the course at the nearest waypoint (default setting), the next closest (it takes the current vehicle direction into account), the current waypoint or directly at the first waypoint.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section class="manualSubSection">
				<h3>Course loaded, not driving + Fieldwork or fertilizer/seeding mode activated</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p class="info">If you want to use AutoDrive to refill/unload/parking, the option will be here.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Return to first point</h4>
						<p>This option is used to define if the driver stays at the last waypoint of the fieldwork course, or drives back to the start.</p>
						<p>In addition, you can also dismiss the driver automatically, as soon as you enter the driver, for quick start driving without dismiss the driver in the HUD.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

						<p>In order to being able to do many different work types, there are different driving modes. Certain modes are only available for certain types of vehicles. For example, a tractor won't be allowed to drive in the <a href="#driveMode9" class="internal"><span class="icon-mode9single"></span> shovel filling and emptying</a> mode. The current mode will be highlighted in green. The mode names are display as a tooltip when hovering over the buttons.</p>
						<p>The different modes are described in detail in the <a class="internalTab" href="#driveModes">Driving modes</a> section.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4><span class="icon-clearCourse"></span>Clear course</h4>
						<p>When a course has been recorded or loaded, you can delete the current course selection. The saved course will not be deleted from the save game, only the driver will clear his current course.</p>

				</ul>
			</section>
			<section class="manualSubSection">
				<h3>Course loaded, driving</h3>

						<h4>Stop driver</h4>
						<p>Of course you can always stop the activated driver. Later, when reactivating the driver, it will continue from the next valid waypoint.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Drive now</h4>
						<p>When you're driving a "filling" course, for example unloading a combine in combi mode, or collecting grass in field work mode, you can force the driver to drive the unloading portion of the route immediately.</p>

			<p>If you don't add any fill type in the HUD list, the tractor waits at the first waypoint (the middle of the trailer will be positioned on the first waypoint) until his trailer has been filled. As soon as the fill level reaches the set percentage (<code>Drive on at %</code>), the driver starts to drive the course. As soon as he reaches an unloading trigger, he unloads automatically. Afterwards he continues the course to return to the first waypoint.</p>
			<p>The last waypoint should be 5 to 10 m ahead of the first, and have somewhat the same direction as the first.</p>
			<p>For loading a fill type at a trigger (e.g. silo) you have to add up to 5 fill types in the HUD list, which will be loaded when:</p>
			<p><li>Run counter is higher then 0</li></p>
			<p><li>Fill type is available in the silo</li></p>
			<p>In case one of those conditions can't be fulfilled, the next fill type will be loaded (if you got more then one).</p>
			<p>In case your selected min value can't be reached, you will get noticed that there is not enough left in the silo.</p>
			<p>If you have more then one trailer (or a multibin trailer) you can load up to 3 different fill types, by clicking at Separate Trailers.</p>

		</article>

		<!-- ### DRIVEMODE2 ### -->
		<article class="manualSection" id="driveMode2">
			<h2><span class="icon-mode2single"></span> Combi</h2>
			<p>The combi mode is very similar to the <a href="#driveMode1" class="internal"><span class="icon-mode1single inline"></span>Grain transport</a> mode, in that the tractor drives a course and unloads at a trigger. But, in addition, the driver unloads a working combine or chopper on the field.</p>
			<p>The tractor waits at the last waypoint until a combine, chopper or harvester calls him. This will happen if:
			<p><li>The combine is driven by Courseplay</li></p>
			<p><li>The combine is selected in the <a href="#hud_manageCombine" class="internal"><span class="icon-page4 inline"></span>HUD:&nbsp;manage&nbsp;combines</a> by clicking the [ ] it will turn into a [X]</li></p>
			<p><li>The combine's fill level is above the percentage (<code>Start&nbsp;at&nbsp;%</code>) set for the tractor</li></p>	
			<p>We also have some conditions on when and where the unloader will go to the combine:</p>
			<p><li>On first headland, the combine will only be unloaded while driving, when the option is set to active in the advanced settings Menu, else the combine will create a pocket at around 95% of its fill level</li></p>
			<p><li>If the pipe is in the fruit, the combine will only call the driver after Combien reversed out of the fruit, or in case there is fruit on both sides, he will also create a pocket at 95% of its fill level</li></p>
			<p><li>In case the pipe is not in the fruit, the combine and unloader will arrange a 'rendezvous' where they should meet up. Depending on several conditions, it is not guaranteed the unloader will make it in time</li></p>
			<p>When the Unloader knows where to go, it will start to drive it's path to the Combine. When the driver is near, the combine will start to unfold the pipe, as soon as the pipe is fully unfolded, the driver will place the trailer under it with an automatic offset, which can be corrected in the offset menu</p>
			<p>If the trailer isn't full yet (<code>Drive&nbsp;on&nbsp;at&nbsp;%</code>), the tractor stops or moves back a bit and waits in the field for his next unloading operation. As soon as the trailer's fill level is above the <code>Drive&nbsp;on&nbsp;at&nbsp;%</code> percentage, the driver will drive to the course's first waypoint, and from there continue the course, unloading the trailer and returning to the field.</p>

			<p>Manual driving the combine is not supported yet, as we have a communication between the combine and the unloader.</p>
		</article>

		<!-- ### DRIVEMODE3 ### -->
		<article class="manualSection" id="driveMode3">
			<h2><span class="icon-mode3single"></span> Overloader</h2>
			<p>The overloader mode is somewhat similar to the combi mode, in that the driver unloads a combine. But instead of the driving a course to an unloading trigger, the driver overloads into a waiting trailer.</p>
			<p>The Course is just as in Combi Mode, but in addition, a <span class="emphasize1">waiting point</span> will be placed next to a waiting trailer. Later, while driving the course, this waiting point tells the overloader to stop, extend the pipe, and start overloading, as long as the trailer is not full, and the fillvolume is not lower then drive on at less then X%. During, an info message <code>XYZ has reached overload point.</code> will be displayed. When the overloaders fillvolume is lower then drive on at lower then X% and the trailer is full, the driver will continue the course and wait at the last waypoint for his next unloading operation.</p>
			<p>To have a less problematic course, the waypoints before and after the waitpoint should have a straight path to not hit any waiting trailers.</p>

Just start near the field and then go through the fertilizer/liquid manure/seeding trigger (or under an overloader pipe), and back to the field, ending near the field. As soon as a refilling trigger is recognized, the driver stops and refills automatically. If a tool isn't fillable via a trigger, but rather manually (e.g. a solid manure spreader), an additional waiting point has to be set and the point where the tool should be filled.</p>
			<p>To refill your worker, you got to select a fill type that needs to be refilled and you can add up to 2 fill types (e.g. seed and fertilizer).</p>
			<p>When driving through a trigger the driver will wait until the tool is filled with the percentage set at your fill type max value (default: 100%).</p>
			<p>For refilling at a wait point, the min value should be increase to the value, at where the driver is allowed drive back to work.</p>
			<p>To add the refill course, first load the fieldwork course with <span class="icon-loadMergeCourse" title="Load/merge course"></span> and then add your refill course with the <span class="icon-courseAppend" title="Append course">.</span></p>

			<p>As soon as the tool is empty, it goes into transportation mode and the driver follows the refilling course. Back at the field, the driver drives to the point on the field where it last stopped work, sets the tool into work mode, and continues working.</p>

			<h2><span class="icon-mode5single"></span> Transfer</h2>
			<p>The transfer mode is the most simple form to get from A to B. It uses a completely regular course with a start and an end point. The driver blindly follows that course, without unloading or other fancy stuff and still stop at the last Waypoint.</p>

			<h2><span class="icon-mode6single"></span> Field work</h2>
			<p>The field work mode is doing all the other work on the field, like harvesting, cultivation, pressing and collecting bales and so on.</p>
			<p>Basically, it works much the same as the fertilizing/seeding mode, only that the tool can/must be emptied/unloaded instead of being refilled.</p>
			<p>The field work course will be created with the course generator, which can be found on the Drive Controls Page.</p>
			<p>The unload course is similar to the refill course of fertilize and seeding mode, just drive through a unload trigger or silo bunker.</p>
			<p>For Unloading combines in a similar way, you just have to load a field work course, turn on 'self unload' and place a trailer that can load the harvested fill type and is on the field or within 20 m of the field edge.</p>
			<p>To add the unload course, first load the fieldwork course with <span class="icon-loadMergeCourse" title="Load/merge course"></span> and then add your refill course with the <span class="icon-courseAppend" title="Append course"></span></p>

			<p>Balers and bale wrapper will stay on field for their work.</p>
			<p>To collect bales and unload them where want with an unload course, the unload course must be a bit different. You need to reverse to the place where you want to create a stack and place an 'unload here' waypoint where the 1st stack should be.</p>

			<h2><span class="icon-mode7single"></span> Bale Collector</h2>
			<p>The old function of this mode got completely replaced by a simple option called 'self unload' which is use for Harvester and Combine (not Choppers), that can load the harvested fill type and is on the field or within 20 m of the field edge.</p>
			<p>The Combine will automatically find its way to the trailer. Just set up a Fieldwork Course and activate the 'self unload' setting.</p>

			<h4>The new Mode is for automatic Bale Collecting.</h4>
			<p>This mode requiers a course that starts from the field to a place where you want to unload the stack of Bales in reverse (unload here Waypoint at the end of the reverse path) and back to the field.</p>
			<p>On the first page, you have to choose the Field, where you want to load the bales.</p>

			<p>The Field supply mode is for transporting anything that you can bring out on a field, like Seeds or liquid manure. The course basically works like Grain Transport, but in addition, you can place a wait point where the Driver stops and is ready to overload to a e.g. a seeder or liquid manure sprayer.</p>
			<p>An Overloader wagon is used for seeds and fertilizer, liqued manure or liqied fertilizer of course require a liquid transport trailer.</p>

			<h2><span class="icon-mode9single"></span> Fill and empty shovel</h2>
			<p>This mode lets you fill a shovel in a designated area (e.g. a BGA silo or manure heap) and unload it into a trigger or trailer.</p>
			<p>The course setup <span class="emphasize1 emphasize2">has to be</span> as follows:</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="../../res/img/manual_mode9_en.jpg" class="infoImg">
				<figcaption>All points and directions in the fill and empty shovel mode</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>How to record the course:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Start in front of the silo, and drive forwards.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>At the point where the shovel should start loading, set waiting point #1. This point indicates the start of the filling area. During the driving of the course, the shovel will be set to the loading position</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>At the end of the silo, set another waiting point (#2). This point indicates the end of the filling area and will move the shovel to the transport position.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Set the direction to <span class="emphasize2">reverse</span>, and reverse back out of the silo (and a bit further). Try to drive as straight as possible.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Set the direction to <span class="emphasize2">forwards</span>, and drive to the trigger or trailer that you want to fill. The last 3 or 4 waypoints of that section should be as straight as possible.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>At the point where the shovel should unload, set waiting point #3.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Set the direction to <span class="emphasize2">reverse</span>, and reverse back as straight as possible.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Set the direction to <span class="emphasize2">forwards</span> and drive back to right before the starting point.</p>
				</li>
			</ol><br />
			<p>Before starting the driver, make sure you've set the necessary <a href="#hud_shovelSettings" class="internal"><span class="icon-page9 inline"></span>shovel positions</a>.</p>
			<p>When starting the driver, he will drive to waiting point #1 and set the shovel to the <span class="emphasize2">loading position</span> (<span class="icon-shovelLoading inline"></span>). He will continue until the shovel is full, then stop and set the shovel to the <span class="emphasize2">transport position</span> (<span class="icon-shovelTransport inline"></span>). He will then switch to the "reverse out of the silo" part of your recording, and continue to drive the recorded course.</p>
			<p>Four waypoints before waiting point #3 the driver will set the shovel to the <span class="emphasize2">pre-unloading position</span> (<span class="icon-shovelPreUnloading inline"></span>) and start looking for a trigger or a trailer to unload to. If nothing has been found, the driver will stop. If something has been found, the driver continues until the shovel is ready to unload into the bunker/trailer. The shovel will then be set to the <span class="emphasize2">unloading position</span> (<span class="icon-shovelUnloading inline"></span>) and unload.</p>
			<p>If filling into a trailer, the trailer does not have to be exactly at/behind waiting point #3, it can in fact be situated slightly in front of it. But, to ensure a perfect procedure, the trailer should be right at your waiting point #3. After unloading, the shovel is set back to the <span class="emphasize2">pre-unloading position</span> (<span class="icon-shovelPreUnloading inline"></span>); the driver will use the "reverse from bunker/trailer" part of your recording and continue the course from the until it reaches the end point.</p>
			<br />
			<p>A second way of using Mode9 will be loading something out of the trigger.</p>
			<p>For this, you got to turn on '' and create a slightly different course.</p>
			<p>In addition, a new option will appear on the shovel page to add a fill type, that you want to load.</p>
			<p>The course should be recorded like this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>The course will start in front of the trigger where you want to unload a fill type.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Drive straight towards the trigger, so you have at least one additional waypoint in front of the trigger after the startpoint.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Set the direction to <span class="emphasize2">reverse</span>, and reverse back from the trigger (and a bit further).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Set the direction to <span class="emphasize2">forwards</span>, and drive to the trigger or trailer that you want to fill. The last 3 or 4 waypoints of that section should be as straight as possible.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>At the point where the shovel should unload, set a waiting point.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Set the direction to <span class="emphasize2">reverse</span>, and reverse back.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Set the direction to <span class="emphasize2">forwards</span> and drive back to right before the starting point.</p>

			<h2><span class="icon-mode10single"></span> Leveling and compacting</h2>
            <p>For this mode, there are 3 different options:

			<p>The course for all 3 options, is the same.</p>
			<p>You attach your tool at the back of your tractor and drive into the bunker. Stay within the first meter of the bunker, the tool points towards the inside of the bunker.</p>
			<p>Start recording the course. The first Waypoint should be inside of the bunker. Drive straight out of the bunker to a save place where you driver can wait for other drivers to unload into the bunker. Place a wait point there and switch to reverse driveing. Then drive in reverse in front of the Bunker and stop the record. That's all.</p>
			<p>For the option to build up, you should use a shield, that option is best used in a wedge silo.</p>
			<p>For the option compacting, a roller should be used, while leveling can use a shield or a spreader like the Fliegl Duo from ModHub.</p>

			<h2>Advanced course generator</h2>
			<p>The course generator is accessible from the Driver Controls HUD Page, but only on fieldwork or fertilizing/seeding mode.</p>
			<p class="info">Keep in mind that some setting combinations, big fields and smal working width can lead into long generation times.
				Your Game won't simple crash and your computer is not hanging up.
				Patience is the key to success!</p>
			
			<p>There are several options that will be listed here. To find the best course for you, we suggest you to try different settings. To do that, just change a value and press 'generate course'. If you don't like the result, change an other value and just press 'generate course' again.</p>
			<p>The Field can be selected by clicking the arrows, use the scroll wheel, or simply click on the Field on the PDA.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p><h3>Field edge path:</h3>
						<p>Current loaded course - you can record a round course and save it to use in the course generator, keep in mind that once a course is generated, the current loaded course is no longer your round course.</p>

					<p>Current vehicle position</p>
					<p>South-west/north-west/north-east/south-east corner</p>
					<p>Select position on map - this can be done by simply click on the PDA at the position where the start should be</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><h3>Bypass islands:</h3></p>
					<p>Off - will ignore any islands on the Field</p>
					<p>Single - will make a simple round bypass</p>
					<p>Circle - will generate a complete circle around the island, which will be driven around completely once</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><h3>Skip rows (0-3):</h3></p>
					<p>This is useful to prevent turns that will do a reverse maneuver</p>
					<p>On odd shaped fields, can lead to visual lines across off field parts, which won't be driven when you have turned on 'use Pathfinder in turns' on the advanced settings page.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><h3>Multiple tools (0-8):</h3></p>
					<p>This is the only option you need, when you want to use more then one tool on a field</p>
					<p>You don't have to add any work width, just set the work width for one tool, the rest will be calculated automatically</p>
					<p>Very important note - do not start a multi tool course with headlands in a corner, it will lead to a bad or up to not working at all inner path (explanation picture might follow)</p>
				</li>

							<p>Start working on (Headland passes / up/down rows) - This setting switches the start with the stop position, keep that in mind if you select a starting position on the map</p>
							<p>Headland corner - smooth - will generate a simple smooth corner</p>
							<p>Headland corner - turn - will generate a sharp corner with a turn maneuver</p>

						<img src="../../res/img/manual_generateCourse_vehicleLocation.png" class="infoImg">
						<figcaption>Start of course is based on vehicle position</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>The algorithm calculates the direction of the up/down tracks in the middle automatically. It finds the direction where
						the number of the generated tracks is the minimum while the field can be covered in a single pass. </p>
					<p>Due to the nature of this automatic alignment, the up/down tracks won't necessarily start where the headland ends,
						so often, there's a connecting track is needed between the two (see the above picture). The vehicle will raise and 
						turn off implements while traveling on that connecting track.</p>

		<article class="manualSection" id="fieldScanner">
			<h2>Field scanner</h2>
			<p>The Courseplay field scanner scans the map's fields and generates a field edge (field border) path. These edge paths can be used as the basis for a course generation. There's no need to drive around the field manually anymore. The automatic scanner runs on every savegame load and does not save or load the paths. The progress of the scan is displayed.</p>
			<p>When you start a new savegame, there will be a dialog where you can activate/deactivate the automatic scan.</p>
			<p>The scanner also features a manual scan setting: drive onto the field, and use the corresponding buttons and orders to create and save your custom field edge path. These custom field scans are saved into and loaded from the <code>courseplayFields.xml</code> file. Please see <a href="#hud_driverControls" class="internal"><span class="icon-page1 inline"></span>HUD: Drive controls</a> for detailed information.</p>
			<p>The field scanner can only scan fields that have a field (cultivated, plowed, seeded) terrain. Meaning: if you've sown grass on a field, it doesn't count as a regular field anymore and the edge points can not be scanned. So if you plan to convert a field to a grass area, make sure to manually scan it first and save the path so you can use it later for generating courses.</p>
			<p>There are multiple scanner settings that can be set in the <code>courseplay.xml</code> file (<code>courseplayFields</code> tag).
				<ul>
					<li><p><code>automaticScan</code>: activate (<span class="emphasize2">"true"</span>) or deactivate (<span class="emphasize2">"false"</span>) the automatic scan</li>
					<li><p><code>onlyScanOwnedFields</code>: if activated (<span class="emphasize2">"true"</span>), only the fields that you own are scanned. Also when you buy a new field, it will be scanned immediately. If deactivated (<span class="emphasize2">"false"</span>), all fields are scanned.</p></li>
					<li><p><code>debugScannedFields</code>: if activated (<span class="emphasize2">"true"</span>), debug information concerning the automatic scan will be printed in the log.</p></li>
					<li><p><code>debugCustomLoadedFields</code>: if activated (<span class="emphasize2">"true"</span>), debug information concerning the manual scan will be printed in the log.</p></li>
					<li><p><code>scanStep</code>: determines how detailed the path is going to be. <span class="emphasize2">Only change if the developer asks you to.</span></p></li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p class="info"><span class="icon-infoSign inline"></span> On some maps, fields are too close together to be scanned correctly. The automatic scanner will most likely stop and/or crash. At the moment there is no viable solution for that problem.</p>

		<article class="manualSection" id="reverseDriving">
			<h2>Reverse driving</h2>
			<p>Courseplay can handle reversing with a trailer attached. Both tandem and pivot trailers are supported. Reversing works both with straight and curved routes. This can be especially useful if a tip trigger or unloading point can't be really reached from the front or the sides. Only one trailer is supported, not multiple simultaneously.</p>
			<p>Be aware of a couple of regulations when reversing with a trailer:
				<ul>
					<li><p>The tractor will align the trailer according to the next waypoint, so there should be enough lateral space.</p></li>
					<li><p>The course should be recorded without a trailer attached, so the real intended course is recorded instead of the tractor's steering.</p></li>
					<li><p>Be aware of the trailer's length; the radius around curves shouldn't be too narrow.</p></li>
					<li><p>When driving backwards, the tip trigger will be found <span class="emphasize2">behind the trailer</span>.</p></li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>Unloading in silage silos can also be done in reverse. When recording the route, reverse to the backend of the silage bin, place an unload here waypoint and change to forward again and continue the route. Unloading will be done at the last found heap.</p>
