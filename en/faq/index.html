			<ol class="faqContent">
				<li>Bugs and suggestion are handled on our <a href="https://github.com/Courseplay/courseplay/issues"><span class="icon-github4"></span> issues</a> page.</li>
				<li>Always update to the latest build and check if the problem really still exists before reporting issues.</li>
				<li>Check if your problem has already been reported by someone else. If so, contribute to that issue instead of creating a new one.</li>
				<li>Write in English. We have users (and developers) from all over the world. And by writing in English, you help them (and us) understand and maybe even contributing to the solution.</li>
				<li>Be descriptive and clear: use a clear title without writing a whole novel. In the text area, describe the situation as precise as possible. Tell us which map and which vehicles and mods you are using.</li>
				<li>Post the complete game log:
					<ol>
						<li>You can find it in the following directory:

			<h2>Which turn to use?</h2>
			<div class="faqContent">
				<h3>What all those turn settings on the Advanced Settings page mean?</h3>
				<p>By default, Courseplay calculates trajectories for turns (headland or an 180° from one row to the next) based on pure geometry, ignoring fruit or any obstacles that may be in the way.

					You can change this behavior on the Advanced Settings dialog, here are the details:</p>
				<h3>Use AI turn maneuvers</h3>
				<p>AI Turn is not using pre-calculated trajectories, just tries to make a simple 3 point turn.

					It is great when the next row is close (narrow working width) and the headland is about a 90° to the up/down rows. It also has some logic to recover from hitting obstacles like trees or fences. Works best with implements mounted on the tractor (not towed) or with combines.
					
					Do not use AI turns when the next row is far away as it won't make sure to stay on field or avoid obstacles.</p>
				<h3>Use pathfinding in turns</h3>
				<p>Activate this if your field isn't rectangular and the next row is far away, so a direct line to it would go through the woods or some other obstacles. This happens often when the working width is high, for example sprayers or spreaders, or if you are using multiple vehicles (convoy). Also, some patterns like lands or racetrack, or skipping rows may result in turns where the vehicle must drive quite a distance to the start of the next row.

					Pathfinding in turns will find the shortest path to the next row, staying on the headland, avoiding fruit and any obstacles off the field.</p>
				<h3>Reversing for pathfinding in turns</h3>
				<p>When pathfinding is enabled in turns, it'll generate paths driving forward only. If you activate this setting and the vehicle can easily be reversed, such as a combine or a tractor with a non-towed implement, Courseplay may generate a turn with a vehicle reversing if that results in a shorter path then a forward only course.</p>

			<h2>Which tools and vehicles does Courseplay support?</h2>
			<div class="faqContent">
				<p>Courseplay supports most default game vehicles and tools as well as most modifications which use the default game scripts.</p>
				<p class="emphasize2"><span class="emphasize1">Note:</span> Courseplay does not automatically cut or handle any trees.</p>
				<p>In addition, we specifically support the following modifications <span class="emphasize2">(valid as of v6.03)</span>:</p>

		<article id="faqOffset" class="singleFaq">
			<h2>How to use the offset? &mdash; a.k.a. how do I let multiple vehicles drive a fieldwork course?</h2>
			<div class="faqContent">
				<p>The <span class="emphasize1">horizontal offset</span> can be used for two different situations:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>The work tool you're using isn't symmetrical, so you need to drive slightly off course (left or right) to have the tool in the path's center. This applies to, e.g., a bale loader, or a side mower. In this case, use the tool offset setting.</li>
					<li>You want to use a group of vehicles to drive side by side, in order to work the field faster. In this case, use a Multitool Course, for more details, check the <a href="../manual/index.html#generateCourse">Advanced course generator.</a></li>
				</ol>

				<h3>The asymmetrical tool (tool offset)</h3>
				<p>On the X axis, calculate (or at least estimate) the distance between the point where the tool should "hit" the path and the vehicle's center. Use that distance as the horizontal offset. For example, the default bale loader (Arcusin) needs an offset of approximately <span class="serif">1.5</span> to <span class="serif">2</span> metres to the <span class="emphasize2">left</span> (as the grabber is on the <span class="emphasize2">right</span> side of the tool).</p>


				<h3>The groupies (lane offset)</h3>
				<p>In order to have multiple vehicles drive in a group, make sure of the following:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Each vehicle uses the same tool, with the same work width.</li>
					<li>Don't start all vehicles at once. If you do so, they will get stuck with another vehicle of the group at one point or the other.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>Each vehicle must use the same generated multitool course</p>

				<p>Staying with the seeder example, vehicle #1 will drive on the <span class="emphasize2">left</span> side of the course, vehicle #2 will drive on the <span class="emphasize2">right</span> side of the course.</p>

				<h3>Regular vs. symmetric lane change</h3>
				<p>There are two methods for setting up the lane usage: <span class="emphasize1">regular lane change</span> and <span class="emphasize1">symmetrical lane change</span>.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="emphasize1">Regular lane change</span>: while in the first lane they will drive side by side, remember that their position, relative to the path, will <span class="emphasize2">always</span> be left/right of the course. So in the next lane, they will appear to switch the positions, but in reality they will still be left/right of the path.</li>
					<li><span class="emphasize1">Symmetrical lane change</span>: the vehicles will effectively leave a free lane for the following vehicle.</li>
				</ul>
